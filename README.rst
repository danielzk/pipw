A wrapper for pip to save packages in requirements files similar to npm.

Installing
==========

.. code-block::

  $ pip install pipw

You can also pass an option to replace the pip command:

.. code-block::

  $ pip install pipw --install-option="--override-pip"

If you want to recover the pip command, you just have to reinstall pip. For
example:

.. code-block::

  $ pip uninstall pip
  $ easy_install pip

Usage
==========

TODO: add envs

.. code-block::

  pipw (install|uninstall) [-e] <package>... [options]

Options:

.. code-block::

  -s, --save        Save packages to the requirements file. This is default
                    unless --no-save. Packages are saved in requirements.txt
                    unless a custom configuration is used.
  -n, --no-save     Prevent save packages to the requirements file.
  --config <path>   Pass a custom config file. By default it looks for a
                    .pipwrc file in the directory where the command is
                    executed, or in the user's home directory.
  -m, --env <name>  Save in a environment previously declared in the config
                    file.
  --help            Show this message and exit.

All pip commands and options are still available.

Config file
-----------

You can create a :code:`.pipwrc` file to use a custom configuration. By default
it looks for the file in the directory where the command is executed, or in the
user's home directory. You can also pass a custom file to the :code:`--config`
option.

Example of a config file:

.. code-block:: yaml

  requirements: requirements.txt
  specifier: ~=
  envs:
      dev: requirements/dev.txt

Environments
------------

As you can see, you can set environment files in the configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

  requirements: requirements/prod.txt
  envs:
      dev: requirements/dev.txt
      test: requirements/test.txt

Use the `-m` (or `--env`) option to save the packages in an environment file:

.. code-block::

  $ pipw install pytest -m test

If no environment is passed, the value defined in `requirements` are used by
default. If this value is not defined, a `requirements.txt` file is used by
default. These files are created automatically if they do not exist.

The `uninstall` command will remove the package in all files, unless the `-m`
option is passed.

Tests
=====

Tests are in :code:`tests/`. To run the tests use one of these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ make tests
  $ make wip-tests
  $ make review-tests

You can also pass the environment. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ make tests env=py35
